**Provide details on the proposal.**
You should describe the feature in as much detail as possible, justifying why it is an improvement and what deficiencies it makes up for. If you are proposing workflows or property changes - describe each step of the workflow in detail and what properties should be available to enable each step, and how it should be used (keeping in mind limitations of the Blender API). If your feature requires UI changes inside Blender - sketch mockups of the proposed UI and attach them (keeping in mind limitations of the Blender UI). If your feature requires changes to the library API - describe the desired import paths, functions, and classes required, and what *exactly* each of those should do. The more blanks you fill in that others do not have to think about, the more likely it is for the proposal to be accepted. Proposals consisting of a few sentences with very low informational content that require contributors to design the majority of the feature are likely to be closed.
