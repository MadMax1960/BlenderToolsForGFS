## Acknowledgements
This is a Blender importer for the GFS file format. The GFS format code has been heavily derived from [GFD Studio](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/GFD-Studio), TGE's [3DS Max importer](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/GFD-Studio/tree/master/Resources/GfdImporter), and the [010 Editor templates](https://github.com/CherryCreamSoda/010-Editor-Templates/blob/master/templates/p5_gfd.bt). Deep thanks are given to all those who have contributed to the understanding of the format.

Additionally, thanks to DniweTamp in the Persona Modding Community for assisting in the comprehension some aspects of the format.
